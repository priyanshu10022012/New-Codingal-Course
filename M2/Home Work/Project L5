        <p style="color:rgb(176, 255, 127)">A waterfall is a river or other body of water's steep fall over a rocky ledge into a plunge pool below. Waterfalls are
        also called cascades. The process of erosion, the wearing away of earth, plays an important part in the formation of
        waterfalls. Waterfalls themselves also contribute to erosion.</p>
