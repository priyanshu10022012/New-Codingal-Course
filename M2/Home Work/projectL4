    <h2>Typography with food</h2>
    <div class="text1">Food typography explores the use of edible materials to create letters and text, merging the visual language of
    typography with the sensory experience of food.</div>
    <div class ="text2">Food typography, also known as "Trofigraphy", takes the principles of typography and applies them to food. This means
    using ingredients like fruits, vegetables, and baked goods to create letters, words, or even entire messages.</div>
    <div class ="text3">It combines the visual appeal of typography with the taste and texture of food, offering a more immersive experience for
    viewers.</div>
    <p class="p1">Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for other animals.</p>
    <p class="p2">Plants which converted solar energy to food by photosynthesis,are the primary food source.</p>
